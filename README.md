# My Assembler

The project consists of three parts. The one is processor emulator that processes the binary execution file. And the other is compiler that generates these execution files from simplified assembly language. And the third is the disassembler which generates assembly code from execution file. You can look at the [example programs](Example_Programs) to see supported assembly features.
